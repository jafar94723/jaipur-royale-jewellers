/*
Routing in SPA

Pros of SPA
1. send an html,js, css only once
2. request data only

Cons:
1. server side rendering
2. lazy loading
3. bigger js file



React is just a view library.
It doesn't give us routing.
browsers are built on the idea
that clicking on a link brings you
another page

So 'back' button wouldn't work
and urls wouldnt change

so browsers give us an history API
to mimic URLS
React Router utilizes this.
